# Preview :photo:

16 color image viewer for the terminal that uses content-aware image resizing.

## Why

I wanted to develop an image viewer that could be usable from within [`o`](https://github.com/xyproto/o), a small editor/IDE I wrote that targets VT100 compatible terminal emulators.

## Features and limitations

* The content-aware image resizing changes the image, but keeps the most interesting content.
* The image resizing is done with [`caire`](https://github.com/esimov/caire).
* The palette reduction is done with [`palgen`](https://github.com/xyproto/palgen).

## Comparison

| Original PNG image                    | In a VT100 compatible terminal emulator, using 16 colors |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src=img/grumpycat.png width=512> |            <img src=img/grumpycat16colors.png width=512> |

The images are changed, but the essence is kept.

## Installation

The `preview` utility can be installed with Go 1.17 or later:

    go install github.com/xyproto/preview/cmd/preview@latest
